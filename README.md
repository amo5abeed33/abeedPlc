1. Box Sorting Algorithm (General):

A software implementation of a box sorting algorithm. This project demonstrates a method for efficiently organizing and categorizing a collection of virtual or represented boxes based on defined criteria. (This description remains general as a box sorting algorithm itself isn't typically directly implemented in PLCsim, which focuses on industrial control.)

2. Garbage Door Simulation:

A simulation (e.g., developed using a suitable simulation environment) modeling the behavior and control logic of a garbage disposal door mechanism. This project could potentially include considerations for eventual PLC control or interaction concepts, though the core simulation likely resides in a separate environment.

3. Motor Control using PLCsim:

A project demonstrating motor control logic implemented and simulated using Siemens PLCsim. This repository contains the PLC program (likely developed in TIA Portal or a similar Siemens programming environment) and any necessary configuration files for simulating the control of an electric motor within the PLCsim environment. This showcases the application of PLC logic for industrial motor control scenarios.
